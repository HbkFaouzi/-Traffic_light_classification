## General info
The standard traffic light is composed of three colors: the red light for **STOP**, the green light for **Go**, and the yellow light to **WARN** the driver that the **RED** signal is about to appear.  
Generally placed at road intersections and crossings, the main objective of the traffic light is to regulate traffic movement. A conclusion of an eight-year study from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration revealed an average of 1578 fatalities each year resulting from at least two vehicle traffic crashes. These crashes often happen at intersections controlled by traffic signals, and 51% of those fatal crashes were caused by drivers who ran red lights. To solve this issue, in this project, we used a deep learning model to classify light traffic states divided into four classes: "**RED**", "**YELLOW**", "**GREEN**", "**OFF**". Using a light self-build network architecture, we obtained **96.51%** as training accuracy and **90.30%** as validation accuracy. The test accuracy is **94.36%**, demonstrating the efficiency of the model. This project is a starting point to developing a wholly artificial intelligence system to monitor our traffic movement. Such a system can be implemented into self-driving cars to improve drivers' and pedestrians' safety.
